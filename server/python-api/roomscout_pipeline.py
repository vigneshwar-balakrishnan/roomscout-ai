- "How do I solve this calculus problem?" → NOT_HOUSING (pure academic)
- "What's the weather like today?" → NOT_HOUSING (general information)
- "Tell me about the history of Boston?" → NOT_HOUSING (general knowledge)
- "What's a good laptop for school?" → NOT_HOUSING (technology purchase)

User query: "{input_text}"

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze if this query relates to ANY aspect of the comprehensive housing ecosystem above
2. Consider if a NEU student might realistically ask this when making housing-related decisions
3. Be INCLUSIVE of housing-adjacent topics that genuinely affect living and housing choices
4. Be EXCLUSIVE of general knowledge questions completely unrelated to housing decisions
5. For ambiguous cases, consider: "Would this question help a student choose where to live or how to live?"
6. Remember: Students consider many factors when choosing housing - safety, social scene, amenities, transportation
7. Context matters: the same question can be housing-related or not depending on the intent

Respond with ONLY:
- "HOUSING" if related to student housing ecosystem or housing decisions
- "NOT_HOUSING" if completely unrelated to housing, living, or neighborhood evaluation
